# Get access to our project:

> We have send you a link (PaulFarault's Github) to get access to our main Project Repository, perhaps you can still look at the source code from here we also add a Log.txt to see the git log.

- We consider that it was better to create a new repository for the project to separate the different job between the lab and the project
- It will be easier to add it to our personnal portfolio
